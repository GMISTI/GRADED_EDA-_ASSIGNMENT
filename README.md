This case study is about using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business setting. Imagine you work for a company that lends money to urban customers. One big challenge they face is deciding who to give loans to, especially when some applicants have little or no credit history. Some people might try to take advantage of this by not paying back their loans.

When the company gets a loan application, they have to make a tough decision. If they approve the loan for someone who can't pay it back, they could lose money. But if they reject a loan for someone who can pay it back, they miss out on business.

The data we have includes information about loan applications, like whether they were approved, cancelled, refused, or unused. We're going to use EDA to see how different factors, like the applicant's characteristics and the type of loan, affect whether someone is likely to default on their payments.

The main goal is to find patterns that show if someone might struggle to pay back their loan. This helps the company decide whether to approve or deny loans, adjust loan amounts, or charge higher interest rates for riskier applicants. Ultimately, the aim is to make sure that people who can repay their loans aren't unfairly rejected.
