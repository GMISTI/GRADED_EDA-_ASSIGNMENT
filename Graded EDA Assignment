In this case study, we're tasked with finding out signs that suggest if a client might struggle to make their loan payments. By identifying these signs, the company can take appropriate actions like denying the loan, offering a smaller loan amount, or charging higher interest rates to riskier applicants. The goal is to make sure that people who can repay the loan aren't rejected. Simply put, we want to figure out what factors make someone more likely to not be able to pay back their loan on time.
